# FE-STARTER

## Introduction

- This repo is a frontend project scaffolding, aimed at quickly building a React SPA frontend project with out-of-box properly configured webpack, Typescript, Babel, es-lint, husky commit-lint etc.

- GitHub Template Repository is used to host this project. As a result you can generate a new repo by using this template, which is quite convenient.

- GitHub Pages auto-publishment is supported with GitHub Action CI and navigtion for React Router SPA is well-optimized, so that your project demo website can be automatically built and published once you push your code to the specified branch.

## Details

- `fe-starter v2.0` uses [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) as UI Component Library. Theme settings can be accessed at `app/theme/index.ts`.
